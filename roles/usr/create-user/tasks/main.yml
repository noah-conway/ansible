# This module is a catch-all for basic user configurations
# Configures git user and email, and configures shell according to specifications
#
# Git user and email defaults to null values, which means the modules won't run by default. Define these variables elsewhere 

# Edits the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.gitconfig file insteat f "git config..." commands: this ensures that this module runs even if git is not currently installed
